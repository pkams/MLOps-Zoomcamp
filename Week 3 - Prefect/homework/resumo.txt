Q1. Converting the script to a Prefect flow

We want to bring this to workflow orchestration to add observability around it. The main function will be converted to a flow and the other functions will be tasks. After adding all of the decorators, there is actually one task that you will need to call .result() for inside the flow to get it to work. Which task is this?

read_data
prepare_features
train_model [X]
run_model

Q2. Parameterizing the flow

Download the relevant files needed to run the main flow if date is 2021-08-15.

For example:

main(date="2021-08-15")
By setting up the logger from the previous step, we should see some logs about our training job. What is the validation MSE when running the flow with this date?

Note you need to download the relevant files to run. Part of this question is understanding which files the flow should be looking for.

The valition MSE is:

[X]11.637
11.837
12.037
12.237

Q3. Saving the model and artifacts

What is the file size of the DictVectorizer that we trained when the date is 2021-08-15?

[X]13,000 bytes
23,000 bytes
33,000 bytes
43,000 bytes

You can bring up the Orion UI and see the work you've been doing. If you are using local Orion, you can start the server with:
